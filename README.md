# GraphicalModels-BayesStat

## Outline
The aim of this project is to develop Bayesian methods for the analysis of multivariate categor-
ical data. In particular, we are interested in inferring dependence relations between categorical
variables, also accounting for possible heterogeneity related to latent clustering structures in the
data.
We adopt graphical models to represent dependence relations between variables: specifically, a
graphical model is a probabilistic model for a collection of random variables based on a graph structure.
